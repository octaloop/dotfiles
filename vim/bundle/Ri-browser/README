Interface for browsing ri/ruby documentation.

Defines the following commands:

  :Ri <arg>
      Lookup the given argument.

  :RiExpand <arg>
      Lookup the given argument but prefix the class/module name
      when in Ri class buffer[1].

and the following mappings:

  <M-i>  Clean prompting for lookup word.
  <M-I>  Prefix class/module if any before prompting. (ex: Array#)

Lookups can also be done using the word under the cursor (WUC)

  <M-]>
      Gready expansion of WUC. This will work for both the
      'Array.new', 'Hash#each' and 'Kernel::block_given?' way of
      specifying a method.

  <M-[>
      Not so gready expansion of WUC but will also prefix the
      class/module when in a Ri class/module buffer[1]. This makes
      it possible to lookup 'Array#each' by invoking it with
      the cursor places on 'each' in the 'Array' class buffer. 

[1] A Ri class/module buffer is a buffer showing all the methods belonging
    to a class or modul. Example: typing ':Ri Hash' followed by enter in
    normal mode with the ri plugin loaded will open the 'Hash' class buffer.

Comes with syntax coloring of the Ri buffer.
